Run the server:

```bash
go build -o notely && ./notely
```

*This starts the server in non-database mode.* It will serve a simple webpage at `http://localhost:8080`.

You do *not* need to set up a database or any interactivity on the webpage yet. Instructions for that will come later in the course!
